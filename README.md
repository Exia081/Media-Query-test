Media Query Automated Test Suite
===============================

Demo: http://timkadlec.com/mq/

How it works:
The test checks to see if a background image or img element has loaded by creating a new image in Javascript, setting the src property, and then checking immediately to see if the image has been loaded, by checking the image.height property.
